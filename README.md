# Apache Flume customizations for developing a secure and universal database auditing platform

A highly scalable, secure and central repository that stores consolidated audit data and optionally listener, 
alert and OS log events generated by the database instances. This central platform will be used for reporting, 
alerting and security policy management. The reports will provide a holistic view of activity across all databases 
and will include compliance reports, activity reports and privilege reports. The alerting mechanism will 
detect and alert on abnormal activity, potential intrusion and much more. As audit data is vital record of 
activity, to protect this information the central repository will reside outside of existing databases and most 
likely in Hadoop eco-system.
